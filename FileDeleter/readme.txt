This is a program to delete files left in the test folder.


This can be done either by clicking the BAT file, or automated with Windows Task Scheduler.
If the test folder is not already created, it will check first and then create the folder in the current working directory. The file can be moved anywhere and still work as long as the garbage files are left in the "TEMPFILES" folder.


I personally use it to clear up my download folder full of random updates and junk. This was my first batch script created.
