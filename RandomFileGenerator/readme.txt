This creates a few random empty files used for testing.

Originally i made it just to test out the batch deleter. Im sure I can use it for something else later on. It creates a few
txt files and folders with random letters/numbers as filenames.

I really did not mean to create a script just to test another script I intended to be my first batch script, but thats
how things work sometimes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In the future if i create another batch script to organize files by name/type im sure this will be used again.
